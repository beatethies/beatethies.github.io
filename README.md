## WELCOME!

I am an applied microeconomist with main research interests in environmental and labor economics. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the [University of Vienna](https://econ.univie.ac.at/).  I earned my PhD in Economics from the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/) in June 2023.

### WORKING PAPERS

  <summary>Abstract | <a href="https://beatethies.github.io/AQ_GitHub.pdf">Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.thevisiblehand.uk/episodes/episode-51">Podcast</a>  <em>The Visible Hand</em> </summary>
Highly skilled knowledge workers are important drivers of innovation and long-run growth. We study how air quality affects productivity and work patterns among these workers, using data from GitHub, the world's largest coding platform. We combine panel data on daily output, working hours, and task choices for a sample of 27,000 software developers across four continents during the period 2014-2019 with information on concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). An increase in air pollution reduces output, measured by the number of total actions performed on GitHub per day, and induces developers to adapt by working on easier tasks and by ending work activity earlier. To compensate, they work more on weekends following high-pollution days, which suggests adverse impacts on their work-life-balance. The decline in output arises even at concentrations in line with current regulatory standards in the EU and US. Exposure to unusually high PM2.5 levels relative to the city-by-season-by-day-of-week specific mean reduces daily output quantity by 4%, which translates into a loss in output value by approximately $8 per developer.

**Prenatal Exposure to Air Pollution and the Development of Socio-Emotional Skills** <span style="color:red">*(Updated!)*</span>

<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> 
Socio-emotional skills are important predictors for life outcomes like education, health and earnings. This paper provides causal evidence on the effect of in-utero exposure to air pollution on socio-emotional ability in childhood. Using thermal inversions to address endogeneity in pollution exposure and data from a representative household survey in Germany, I find that an increase in fine particulate matter concentration by 1 Î¼g/m3 during the prenatal period increases neuroticism and internalizing behavior at age 5-10 by 13% and 18% of a standard deviation, respectively. This implies that affected children are less emotionally stable and suggests adverse impacts on mental health. Back of the envelope computations indicate that a standard deviation increase in fine particulate matter reduces adult earnings by 0.23%-0.74% through its impact on socioemotional ability. </div>
